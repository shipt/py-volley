# Contributing to Volley

## Welcome
We are glad you are here! We think it's awesome that you want to spend time helping us make Specter even better. We really value the community we get to be a part of, and we are grateful for your contribution.

Contribution requires signing a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) via HelloSign, a process automated as a part of a pull request.  Your Github email address must match the email address used to sign the CLA. Github has [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-on-github/) on setting email addresses. Your git email must also match this email address.

The basic workflow:
1. Fork Volley
2. Start a new branch for your feature
    * We are not picky about branch prefixes. But generally:
      * `/username/<featureName>`: for features
      * `/username/<fixName>`: for general refactoring or bug fixes
3. Submit a Draft Pull Request. Do it early and mark it `WIP` so a maintainer knows it's not ready for review just yet.
4. If you haven't signed our CLA before, then you will receive an email from HelloSign to sign the CLA.
    * The CLA request will be sent to the email address associated with your github account.
    * You cannot have your PR merged without signing the PR.
    * If you already submitted a PR and need to correct your user.name and/or user.email please do so and then use `git commit --amend --reset-author` and then `git push --force` to correct the PR.
5. Request review from one of our maintainers. 
6. Get Approval. We'll let you know if there are any changes that are needed. 
7. Merge your changes into Volllet.

Pull Requests: 
- Submit a PR to get your changes approved

- Merge!

## Community Guidelines
