# Extending Volley

Volley can be extending by developing additional connectors, serializers, and model handlers.

Briefly:

- __Connectors__ handle consuming and producing data to/from a data store
- __Serializers__ convert bytes to a primative python object
- __Model handlers__ convert primative python object to user defined data models

Each of these can be extended with custom and community contributed plugins.
